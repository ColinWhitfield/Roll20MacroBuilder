# Roll20MacroBuilder

Roll20 Macro Builder helps players streamline the creation of power card template macros. A roll20.net account is required and prior to creating a template macro with this tool you'll need a few pieces of information.

•	Roll20.net account (free at http://www.roll20.net).
•	A D&D4e character sheet inside a previously created game.
•	Power abilities on the character sheet. These are listed as power-1, power-2, power-3. Roll20 supports up to 100 powers.
 

Once you have your powers setup you can open up the macro builder tool and start crafting your template macros. These macros will live in the abilities -> Macros section of the d&d4e character sheet. You can either add them to the macro bar or token bar.
